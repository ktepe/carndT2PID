## Manual Parameter tuning:

1-Adjust Kp such that the car stays on the road until it gets as close as possible to the entrance of the bridge and oscilates (goes side to side) while moving.

2- Pick Kd as 10 times arger than Kp as initial value and increase or decrease it until the car's oscilation dampens but it tracks a relatively steady track.

3- Adjust Ki as 10 times smaller than Kp as inital value and adjust it to reduce CTE value as much as possible.

When the car drives steadily, re-adjust Kp, Ki, and Kd to provide a sharper turns at the steep curves (especially entering and exiting bridge).

With these, I have concluded that Kp=0.1, Ki=0.001, Kd=0.5 provided enough stability to run the car in the entire track. 

However, when the car speed increased to higher speeds 50 mph, then Kp=0.08, Ki=0.005 and Kd=0.5 worked better.

Also a small adjustments made to the trootle value to reduce the speed when CTE increases and adjust the trootle to keep the car at the target speeds.


```C
double trottle_value= -0.01*(speed-target_speed)-0.02*(fabs(cte));
```

With these, the car completes the track without leaving the drivable portion. With trottle adjustment it is more stable.

There's an experimental patch for windows in this [PR](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-PID-Control-Project/pull/3)

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./pid`. 

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/f1820894-8322-4bb3-81aa-b26b3c6dcbaf/lessons/e8235395-22dd-4b87-88e0-d108c5e5bbf4/concepts/6a4d8d42-6a04-4aa6-b284-1697c0fd6562)
for instructions and the project rubric.

## Hints!

* You don't have to follow this directory structure, but if you do, your work
  will span all of the .cpp files here. Keep an eye out for TODOs.

## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to we ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
